# Adrian - Rhythm Game Mechanic

This is the rhythm game mechanic for my team's TalTech GameCamp 2024 Gamejam submission.  
I wasn't able to finish it during the jam, so I am working on it now.  

Just a note that this is very much a WIP, but you can have a look at the code, if you are curious :3  

## What I have made so far:  
- A working input system, using keyboard keys
- A "Beatmap" (reffered to as Notemap) reader, which gets the info for spawning Notes and Rows
- An object spawner, which creates Notes and Rows (A container for handling logic related to Notes)
-
